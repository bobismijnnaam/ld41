# Ce n'est pas un jeu de pointer-et-cliquer

In english: _This is not a point-and-click game_

Nothing is what it seems, and we can't trust reality. In theory any two game genres can be combined. To truly achieve enlightenment, one must traverse the hyper-realms of genre-spaces to discover combinations that are truly incompatible. Today we will experience such an awkward combination: Point-and-Click and still life. Inherently paradoxical, impliticly useless. Or is it? Pick your platform and good luck!

## Controls
WASD/arrow keys to walk
Mouse to look around
Sound for story indicators, so turn it on and pay attention! :-)

## Known bugs
- On windows the mouse pointer remains visible. Sorry for the inconvenience.
- Mouse speed can be crazy high with touch pads. Using a regular mouse solved that for me
- Very sometimes in the dark intro screen the game freezes. Only had that happen to me once on linux, never on windows. If that's the case just kill the game and restart it.
